Main Differences between 10/50 BCPL and TENEX BCPL.
--------------------------------------------------

1] Structures: These are completely different.
   A structure definition looks a bit like a PL/1 Structure
   Definition. Structure References look like
   <expr> << <selector>
   <expr> >> <selector>
  << implies that the <expr> is the thing to be selected from
   >> implies that the <expr> points to the thing to be selected from

2] Concrete Syntax:
   \ means LOGOR
   'reserved' words are in lower case
   '<text>' is an ASCIZ string
   "<text>" is a normal BCPL string. ( Characters packed four per word)
   $<char> is the ascii code for <char>
   {} [] are section brackets
