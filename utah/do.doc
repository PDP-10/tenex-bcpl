   DO is a sub-system for  expanding  a  parameterized  text

string  from a specified file, and passing the result to the

EXEC for execution.  Parameters are indicated in the  source

(text) file by a % character, followed either by 

      1.  a digit, or

      2.  a character other than % or  an  alphabetic  or  a

digit,  followed  by an arbitrary text string not containing

the character,  followed  by  the  second  instance  of  the

character.


   For each parameter, the user is asked  for  a  text  word

(arbitrary   text   delimited  by  space,  tab,  or  cr)  to

substitute for each instance of the parameter in  the  input

text  string.  He is prompted for this word by the digit, if

a parameter of type 1, or by the textstring, if a  parameter

of  type  2.   Each uniquely named parameter is prompted for

only once, even if it is used several  times  in  the  input

text string.


   The % character has two other uses:

      1.  Two adjacent % characters expand  to  a  single  %

character  (this is an escape convention for % characters in

the expanded text string).  

      2.  A % character followed by an alphabetic  character

form   a  unit  which  expands  into  a  particular  string,

depending on the alphabetic character, as follows:

         %C => name  of  directory  to  which  this  job  is

connected

         %D => date and time

         %J => job number for this job

         %L => name of directory under which this job logged

in

         %R =>  milliseconds of run time used by this job so

far

         %T => (octal) number of TTY attached to this job


   The DO program expands  the  parameterized  input  string

into  a  temporary  text  file,  then  makes  this  file the

"PRIMARY INPUT FILE" (in place of the TTY) for the EXEC in a

lower fork.


   DO is designed to allow user type-ahead while it  or  the

lower   EXEC  is  running,  and  to  allow  interruption  by

control-c ,  and  subsequent  resumption  via  the  CONTINUE

command.   The  DO  program  terminates  with a message when

either the lower fork terminates, or the end-of-file is read

in its primary input file.
