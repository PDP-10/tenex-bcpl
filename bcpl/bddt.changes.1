This version contains several bug fixes:

1) For use on the DECSystem 20, all occurrences of $*N (ASCII 37)
have been changed to *C*L

2) For use on the DECSystem 20, a line-feed immediately following
a  carriage-return is ignored (TENEX generates an EOL rather than
a carriage-return, hence this change is compatible)

3) A potential hole in the breakpoint proceed logic was plugged.
