Subject: ReadWord, IOFMT, BCALL, IBCALL, BCALL1, IBCAL1

	The following 3 changes were made to BCPLIB.REL :
1) A bug in the handling of the 4th arg to ReadWord (skipbool) in
   UTIL was fixed.
2) A few bugs in the FORTRAN like output IOFMT.BCP were fixed.
3) In addition to BCALL and IBCALL, there are now BCALL1 and IBCAL1,
   which reset the TTY Mode word, and breaking characters as they
   normally are in BCPL (i.e. break on every character).  There are
   saved and restored on return.

Changes:
1) sfptr has been fixed to return 0 when it is successful as it is
described as doing in the BCPL manual (p. 73).
2) STRING.REL has been put into BCPLIB.
3) INTTXT.REL has been put into BCPLIB.  This contains the two routines
inttotxt and inttoocttxt (see BCPL manual p. 91).

	A new version of BCPLIB.REL has been put up: it
is on <subsys> on [bbna], and on <bcpl> on the other systems,
as usual.
	The changes are:
	1. BIN(-routinename) which calls a routine to do the
input, was calling the routine with two arguments, not one as
it should have.  This was fixed.
	2. BCMAIN now has an entry vector of length 10, instead
of just 3 as it was before.  In case you didn't know, when you
jump to BCMAIN+n, using the JSYS SFRKV or whatever,  n  is
the argument that Start is called with.  So you can
say "let Start(EntryPointNumber) be ..."
The EXEC command START goes to BCMAIN+0, and
REENTER goes to BCMAIN+1.


	Any problems, gripe to HALBERT@BBNA.

Fixed up OF.BCP for two bugs
1) Calling OpenFile with a negative source does not call FindInput
   and CreateOutput any more.
2) If the source is a string, confirmation from the teletype is not
   required.

from 0, 1, or 2; 0 otherwise.

WriteS now does an immediate return if it is given a string
having a count of zero. Note that there is no need to have the
whole first word be zero (no need for PadString).

Two cases of ANDing with #777 were replaced by "q4z".

Replaced findsubstr completely because it contained VERY bad
bugs.

Made a small fix to scanpastst so that it NOW does start the scan
at rv chnlv.

Not extensively tested, as crash progra to provide it to a
client.

In-Reply-To: Your message of April 2, 1976    
Fcc: <DOCUMENTATION>BCPLIB.CHANGES,
Fcc: <JMILLER>BCPL-SYSTEM.DIALOGUES 

I've  fixed the bugs you mentioned (i.e.  if you give it a source
of 1 or 2 it repeats until you give a valid  file  name,  and  it
prints  the  name  of the file you give if called with a string),
and installed it on [BBNA]<SUBSYS>BCPLB2.REL;30012.  I'm  sending
a  copy  of  this  message to Phil French, who (I hope) will take
care of installing it on the other BBN systems.

--Jim

P.S.  -- Phil,  the  source  file  for  the  changed  program  is
<DEV-BCPLIB>BCPLIO.BCP,  and the file to be installed on <SUBSYS>
is <DEV-BCPLIB>BCPLB2.REL (which is the BCPL run-time library).

Bug  fixes  in BPSI (interrupt package) and BYTEIO (low level I/O
handlers) to fix some spurious errors occurring when an interrupt
arrived within the Writech code.
