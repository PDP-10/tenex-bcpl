                   BCPL Changes -- 7/5/74
                        Paul Rovner

1.  New :: commands are "request",  "require",  and  "ifdebug"..   The
   first  two  should  be  followed  by a list of rel file names to be
   treated as libraries and searched  (if  REQUEST)  or  automatically
   loaded  with  this rel file (if REQUIRE).  File names may specify a
   TENEX directory in the normal (<foo>) way.   The  "ifdebug"  pseudo
   command will cause the rest of the source line to be ignored by the
   compiler if the compilation is NOT done with the (new) /d  compiler
   switch.   Otherwise,  (i.e.  if the /d switch is given) the line of
   source code is compiled.  /d stands for "DEBUG", and allows a  user
   to  specify  parts  of  his code which are for program development,
   when efficiency is less important than getting the program to work.
   Once  the  program works, these "extra" parts of the program may be
   trimmed out of the production version by  just  not  using  the  /d
   compiler switch.

2.  More globals: Users may define global  numbers  between  #400  and
   #1377

3.  More names: Space for user defined names was increased.

4.  New unary operator: "csize"
   This is like "size", the operator that returns the number  of  bits
   in  a structure.  The difference is that "csize" returns the number
   of "address units" in a structure...on TENEX, that is the number of
   machine  words.   "csize" is initially unreserved ; the "::reserve"
   pseudo command is needed if you want to use "csize".
